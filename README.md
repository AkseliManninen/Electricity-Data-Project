# Project plan

## Project goal

The goal of the project is to create end-to-end data pipeline and visualize the results.

## Project phases

The initial plan for the iteration is the following:

1. Find an interesting API that provides data at least on a weekly rate but preferable on daily or more often.

2. Move the data from the API to S3 bucket using AWS Lambda.

3. Use AWS Glue to modify data and to push to a database. The database could be MySql / DynamoDB.
3. Or use SageMaker to do ML on the data, and then push to a database.

4. Visualize the results, either in PowerBI, or construct a Flask website.

5. Use Terraform for Infrastructure-as-Code


## 1 APIs

The first phase is to search and select an interesting API which provides the data. The API should provide new data often, preferably at least daily. Data is in the core of this project, so finding an awesome API is important.

The format of the data should be primarily numbers and strings. In order to do some kind of statistical analysis or machine learning, the number format would be the easiest. However, other types of data are not totally excluded from consideration.

1.1 7Timer
7Timer provides data about weather. For example predicting weather in Otaniemi (not sure if this API provides data for that area).

1.2 API-NBA
NBA API provides data about NBA games. For example, predicting if a team wins could be fun. The data might not be frequent enough for this project.

1.3 Twitter API
Twitter API provides tweets. Tweets could be utilized for example in NLP.

1.4 Fingrid API
This API provides data about Finnish electricity production and consumption.

1.5 Norpool API
This Api provides the prices for electricity in the Nordics.
