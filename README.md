# Project plan

The goal of the project is to create end-to-end data pipeline and visualize the results.

The initial plan for the iteration is the following:

1. Find an interesting API that provides data at least on a weekly rate but preferable on daily or more often.

2. Move the data from the API to S3 bucket using AWS Lambda.

3. Use AWS Glue to modify data and to push to a database. The database could be MySql / DynamoDB.
3. Or use SageMaker to do ML on the data, and then push to a database.

4. Visualize the results, either in PowerBI, or construct a Flask website.

5. Use Terraform for Infrastructure-as-Code
