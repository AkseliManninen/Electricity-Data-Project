# Project description

The electricity data project was established in the mids of an European energy crisis. The motivation for the project is to to distribute electricity related infromation in a structed and insightful way. The data is collected from public sources.

## Project implementation

Data is collected from two APIs: 
1. Fingrid API - The API provides data about Finnish electricity production and consumption.
2. Nordpool API - The API provides the prices for electricity in the Nordisc.

The data is collected from the APIs daily to Amazon Web Services' S3 data strorage using AWS Lambda functions. Then the data is moved from S3 with an ETL tool AWS Glue to a MySQL relational database. From there a connection is established with Google's Looker Studio, and the data is visualised. The aim is that the analytics are then embedded on a website.

In the project, Github is used for version control and Terraform is used for Infrastructure-as-Code.

## Architecture

The graph below describes the implemented architecture rougly. There will be some additional components like for example AWS CloudWatch triggering Glue, which is not included yet in the desing.

AWS Lambda makes API calls to fetch data and then stores the data in a S3 bucket. Lambda is triggered by Cloudwatch (add to the architecture) daily. From the S3 bucket Glue reads the data, modifies it and stores to a database. From a database data can be accessed with PowerBI which has built-in integration.

## 3. Terraform
The next step is to define AWS resources using Terraform. 

- S3 - Store data fetched from the API 游릭
- Lambda 游리
-   Lambda function 1 - Fetches 1 year of data and adds it to S3  游릭
-   Lambda function 2 - Fetches the data from previous day and adds it to the existing csv 游릭
-   Include NordPool and more data points from Fingrid 游리
- Cloud Watch 游리
  - Event rule - Triggers the Lambda function 2 daily 游릭
  - Event rule - Triggers Glue crawlers daily 游리
- Glue 
  - Glue databases for S3 and RDS 游릭
  - Glue crawler for S3 游릭
  - Glue crawler for RDS 游릭
  - Glue job 游릭
- RDS 游릭

## Requirements:
- Terraform
- AWS CLI
- requests library

Configuring AWS with CLI (aws configure command): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxTcw7UTues

## Installing request with AWS Lambda layer
- create a folder called python > pip3 install requests -t . --no-user > zip folder > add as a lambda layer (apparently the folder and zip needs to be named python to work): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BH79Uciw5w&t=70s
